# TO DO

- [ ] Thread list meta: show replies count, last bump time, OP card tags.
- [ ] Tripcode-style identity: optional “deck tag” or format tag for anonymity with flavor.
- [ ] Fast reply: bottom-right slide-up reply box with markdown preview + card syntax.
- [ ] Card hover: auto-render [[Card Name]] as tooltip with set/price links.
- [ ] Format filters: quick toggles for Standard/Modern/EDH/Pioneer.
- [ ] Bump limiter: soft cooldown + bump warning for necro posts.
- [ ] Post tools: inline quote/anchor linking with >>123 and backlink map.
- [ ] Flair auto-rarity: use post ID suffix to emit rare foil glows, give OP a gold ring.
- [ ] Archive mode: lock old threads but keep searchable via tags.
- [ ] Minimal mod tools: soft-delete with reason, report queue with categories.
